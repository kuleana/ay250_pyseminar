AY 250 homework #5 README

code: 
predictelections.py
>run predictelections

This generates three databases: candidates.db, races.db, predictions.db as per homework assignment. Backup copies of these are in this directory as races_backup.db etc.

It also produces the Obama plot and the three north-south plots. Copies of these are saved as obamawins.png and northsouth*.png

Images are saved in the pictures/ directory. You can see the code that generated them within predictelections.py- it is commented out at the moment.

answer to question f:
Periods of inefficiency in our political market:
September 2011:
Hillary Clinton has a spike in popularity (as seen in her intrade chart), which causes a decrease in Republican prediction that is NOT due to Obama.
April/June 2011:
Around the end of May, many potential Independent/Democratic candidates declared that they would NOT be running for the presidency. Thus their "stock" dropped to zero at this time, decreasing the discrepancy between Obama victory predictions and non-Republican victory predictions.

If we define an "efficient market" as P(Obama wins)=1-P(Republican wins), our market is inefficient because it is not a perfectly two-party system, and current presidents can be challenged by members of their own party.

NOTES:
1. code takes awhile to run...
2. north-south probabilities only include states in the eastern half of the US
