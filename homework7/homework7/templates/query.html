                <p> A database is present. You can query it with the
		form below. <br \> Use SQL query syntax to enter the
		query string that follows the "WHERE". <br \> Column
		names are "tag", "author_list", "journal", "volume"
		(integer), "title", "pages", "year" (integer), and
		"collection". <br \> To use wildcards, use "LIKE"
		and employ the "%" (percent symbol) as multiple
		character wildcard and "_" (underscore) as single
		character wildcard. <br \> Make sure to explicitly
		put strings in quotes. </p>
